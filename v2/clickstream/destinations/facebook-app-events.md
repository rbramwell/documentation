Available for server-side and mobile sources, Astronomer Clickstream makes it easy to send your data to Facebook App Events. Once you follow the steps below, your data will be routed through our platform and pushed to Facebook App Events in the appropriate format.

## What is Facebook App Events and how does it work?

Adding app events to your application or website helps you learn more about your audience and the actions people take across channels within Facebook Analytics. Plus, you can use app events to:

- Measure your mobile app ad performance
- Build Custom Audiences
- Optimize mobile app engagement ads

Facebook App Events are powered by Facebook SDKs that you'll have to separately install and configure in your iOS and Android apps. Facebook also has a JavaScript library for collecting events from your site code.

It's also worth noting that Facebook has a standard set of events that need to be installed for various industry verticals. Otherwise, Facebook supports custom events so that your team can add location, and event details for promotion purposes.

User traits like birthday, city, gender, etc. get passed directly through to [Facebook Pixel](facebook-pixel.md).

## Getting Started with Facebook App Events and Astronomer Clickstream

### Facebook App Events Side

Once you have a Facebook Apps account, all you'll need to do is retrieve your 15-digit App ID. You can find this directly on your [dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/).

Once that's set, you'll need to know what specific events you want to map. For each event, we'll ask you for the event *key* (e.g. `Products Searched`) as well as the *value* (e.g. `fb_mobile_search`).

### Astronomer Side

Now that you have what you need from the Facebook Apps side, go ahead to your Astronomer [dashboard](https://app.astronomer.io/login).
